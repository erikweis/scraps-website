### 01/24: Empowerment: A universal goal for robots?

Empowerment is an information theoretic quantity which measures the amount of control an agent has over its environment. Whereas the field of AI tends to focus on task-dependent fitness functions, empowerment is universal and task-independent, allowing for its measurement in any agent-environment interaction. There are connections to be made to empowerment across a vast range of scenarios, which we’ll talk about. And instead of going deep into the details of my empowerment research which may be incredibly boring, we’re instead going to dangerously speculate together about what empowerment might mean in evolution, humans, and artificial intelligence.

### 1/31: Using the VACC

Tips and tricks to using Vermont's compute cluster!

### 2/7: Infectious Disease in Common Loons

*Ericka Griggs*: Infectious diseases increasingly pose threat to naïve host populations and species including humans, livestock and wildlife. Malaria parasites (genus Plasmodium) and other vector-borne parasites of the Order Haemosporidia are increasing due to climate change, making them important agents of infectious disease in birds worldwide. In the case of the Common Loon, malaria has recently been found to cause mortality in breeding adults in the northeastern U.S. Using archived blood samples and retrospective data can we infer population level impacts of blood parasite infections in common loons?

### 2/14: The fractal structure of pulmonary fibrosis

*Dylan Casey*: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and deadly lung condition characterized by altered collagen that leads to lung stiffening. This alteration is usually attributed to excessive deposition of collagen fibers, but there is mounting evidence it is more driven by reorganization of collagen structure. Objectively assessing the modification of collagen structure in a disease notorious for its heterogeneous presentation remains elusive. Images of spatially complex structures are often analyzed in terms of the fractal dimension, but established methods provide a global metric that can mute fibrotic regions. We sought to develop a fractal dimension that captures local scaling behavior of collagen-stained lung sections. This metric produces fractal dimension distributions for whole images that skews more complex areas to higher dimensions. Using this analysis, we find that treatments that can reduce collagen content do not return the altered structure back to normal.

### 2/28: Improving AlphaFold? Machine learning for solving protien structures

*Justin Paluba*: Modern biology and medicine relies heavily on known protein structures to understand how the body works and how best to treat disease. Proteins that exhibit high flexibility characteristics cannot be resolved using current methods. Machine learning programs designed to solve protein structures such as Alphafold or Rosettafold may fill this gap and help us better understand proteins that were previously too difficult to study.
