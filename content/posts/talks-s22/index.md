### 01/31: How can the complex systems lens help to improve democratic policymaking?

How can the complex systems lens help to improve democratic policymaking? 1) We can analyze the structure of policymaking systems and look for potential areas of weakness or improvement. I'll offer a brief summary of the arguments posed in The Robust Federation, a book that fuses traditional literature on federalism with a complex systems view of feedback loops. 2) In many cases the object of policymaking (the economy, digital communities, etc.) can be seen complex networks, both with adaptive structure and multiple processes occurring on them. The problem of optimal interventions in these systems is huge and ill-defined, but perhaps the problem may be easier with access to real-time measurements of the system state. What parts of the system are most useful to measure? How should we manage tradeoffs in measuring the system and in intervening in it? 3) Could adaptive policies (applying targeted micro-interventions depending on real-time system state) augment the policymaker's toolkit?
