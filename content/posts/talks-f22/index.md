### 9/6: A network compression approach for quantifying the importance of temporal contact chronology

*Andrea Allen*: Most simple disease models assume that the population is randomly mixed, but real-world populations exhibit heterogeneous patterns in the way people interact. These differences in population structure can be represented by networks, which can be incorporated into disease models by using various interdisciplinary concepts and tools. Yet even network disease models often overlook that populations change over time. To model a changing population, we can define a sequence of different networks that each are valid for a snapshot in time. Although, how to construct these networks from real contact data, from things like wearable sensors, is a nontrivial problem. We present a method to ascertain if temporal data can be aggregated into a single network, or not. This method underlies an algorithm for compressing real data into a time-varying sequence of networks, creating a system still tractable enough to use existing network analysis tools. We show how fine- grained temporal contact data can be compressed into just a handful of ordered, static networks while preserving the most significant temporal trends of the dynamic population.

### 9/13: COVAsim adaptation to HPVsim and Cellsim

*Mariah Boudreau*: COVAsim adaption to HPVsim and Cellsim- Mariah discussed her contract work with the Institute for Disease Modeling at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The project entails leveraging previous COVID models to population and with-in host modeling of human papillomavirus. Along with explaining how each of these models have been developed for Open Source use, she discussed her work experiences in a non-profit compared to academia.

### 9/20: A Random Walk Down the Road to Larissa

*Will Thompson*: Throughout human history humans have sought to structure discourse in its many forms, I present a model of discourse as a random walk across a space of topics. By fitting these walks to data taken from philosophical treatises, parliamentary debate or online discussion. By coarse graining the flow of texts we show the emergence of large scale structure in discourse and compare its forms across media.

### 9/27: Interactive Visualization of Complex Systems with P5.js

*Lapo Frati*: Thoughts are not black and white frames. They use color and motion and sound. A piece of paper can capture some of them but wouldn't it be nice to have a more flexible medium?
Let's not reinvent the wheel, the browser provides all the graphic primitives needed to create amazing interactive experiences. Be it to share [cool complex systems](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/) or [creative coding](https://openprocessing.org/) or AI (https://www.tensorflow.org/js) there is a bit for everyone.
If you would like to learn more join us tomorrow at SCRAPS for a tour of "all things interactive" starting from [p5](https://p5js.org/) a popular framework for creative coding. Laptops are welcome if interested in a hands-on experience.

### 10/4: Evolutionary Comutation: embodied intelligence, morphological computation, and soft robotics

*Federico Pigozzi*: Natural evolution has produced lifeforms capable of surviving in every environmental niche of Earth. It is plausible that artificial evolution can design specialised robots for various environments and tasks. Evolutionary Robotics (ER) investigates how to leverage evolutionary computation to design the body and the controller of robots. In this talk, you will be guided on a journey through ER. In the first part, you will discover how researchers were inspired by nature with the concepts of embodied intelligence, morphological computation, and soft robotics. A promising direction of current research is to evolve voxel-based softbots, that are aggregations of homogeneous soft blocks. Having distributed volume changing capabilities, voxel-bots can accomplish tasks impossible to humans. In the second part, you will understand what are the open issues in the literature and how I tried to address them. In particular, we will touch upon how to fully exploit the collective intelligence of voxel-bots, how to seek diversity in populations  of robots, and how to effectively exploit shape change with pressure-based softbots.

### 10/11: Digital phenotyping of disease and disorder: examining behaviors and physiology to identify, triage, and intervene

*Bryn Loftness*: Bryn covered a bunch of different stuff from several project, ranging from network analysis of wifi check-in co-occurances to her work to identify digital phenotypes of mental health disorders in pre-adolescent children.

### 10/18: Swine production as directed, hierarchical, modular networks

*Sam Rosenblatt*: Swine production networks are complex systems with thousands of moving aspects. Agent based models of these systems have taken decades and dozens of scientists to create. Despite their complexity, the qualities of these systems and their models can be broken down into specific qualities that have individually been researched by network scientists. We are breaking these systems down and considering each aspect individually in order to identify core questions about the system which we can then test on the larger more complex agent based models.

### 10/31: Algorithm Configuration Problem (ACP) for SCIP

*Annie Zhang*: There are several different commercial solvers available for solving combinatorial optimization problems, like Gurobi and SCIP. One way to improve the performance of these solvers is to find algorithm hyperparameter settings, or algorithm configurations, that will increase the speed at which the solver finds the optimal solution. This approach - finding good algo configs - is called the algorithm configuration problem (ACP). This talk will discuss applications of Hyperband, an approach to solving the ACP thatâ€™s exclusively been used for ML algorithms, and ML to solving the ACP for SCIP.

### 11/8: Time Management

We discussed graduate as managing scientific projects, allocating time across the many disparate tasks we do every day, and other challenges of being a graduate student!

### 11/15: What is social decentralization?

*Milo Trujillo*: Discussed how we measure the influence one online community has over another, how we can compare how centralized different social media and collaboration platforms are, and a little on what this tells us about platform design as a whole.

### 11/30: Agent based models of financial markets

*Ethan Ratliff-Crain*: When taking 'a stylized view of the facts' to assess competing models of financial markets, does the commonly used list of 'stylized facts' still hold in modern markets where automated algorithms react in a matter of microseconds? How does our framing of 'time' impact the behavior observed? I will give an introduction to these concepts and to my research so far with the CompFi lab.


### 12/6: Discussions of homelessness on twitter

*Yoshi Bird and Sarah Grobe*: Lexicocalorimeter-like approach to US state-level homelessness rates. Featuring allotax diagrams, colorful linear embeddings, live analog data demonstration, and, most importantly, pizza!

### 12/13: Science open mic!

Lots of fun stuff! Final projects from classes, tons of new and ongoing work. Everyone presented for 3 minutes max!
